# extension-spoofer

A simple Python script to spoof the extension of a Windows executable file.

It is recommended to choose a file name finishing by the same letters of your original file 
since the extension is not removed but simply reversed, thanks to the Unicode code "U+202E".

For example, if the extension of your original file is ".exe", it's better to rename it 
by a word finishing by "exe" (like "annexe", "reflexe", etc) to make it more coherent.
